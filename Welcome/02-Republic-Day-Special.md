## Historical Context

- **November 26, 1949:** Constitution adopted by the Constituent Assembly
- **January 26, 1950:** Constitution came into effect

## Alternative Interpretations

Some participants might consider:
- `26_01_2026` - The CTF event date (also Republic Day)
- `15_08_1947` - Independence Day

However, the challenge specifically asks about becoming a **Republic**, which refers to 1950.
